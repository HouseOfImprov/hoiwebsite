						<h1>About</h1>
						<h2>
							Comedy, plays, musicals, and more - all made up entirely on the
							spot!
						</h2>
						<p>
							We are a comedy troupe from the University of Oxford who perform
							"Who's Line is it Anyway?" style improvised comedy sketches and
							games, as well as full show length improvised comedy plays and
							musicals. Everything - the plot, the characters, the lines, the
							songs, and even the sound and lights - is made up entirely on the
							spot based on sugestions from the audience. We audition for new
							cast members every year and run free workshops each week of the
							university term for anyone interested in learning the art of
							improv.

						<h1>Workshops</h1>
						<h2>Want to have a go?</h2>
						<p>
							We run free open workshops every week of the University of Oxford
							term, currently at Wadham college. Workshops focus on building
							core improv skills and are suitable for absolutely anyone who
							wants to give improv a try. Whatever your background and
							experience, improv is a fantastic way to develop confidence in
							front of an audience, express yourself, and have fun. If you'd
							like to see what workshops are all about, but are nervous about
							standing up and performing in front of a group, then newcomers are
							also welcome to join a session just as an "audience member".
